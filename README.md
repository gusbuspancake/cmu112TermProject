simple resources, players must build a vast dugeon full of traps and troops to defend, as well as construct an army to DEMOLISH their opponent's dungeon!

- All buildings (except the entrance) have 100 health and can be destroyed by enemy troops attacks. Troops only target a building if there are no enemy troops in the room. When a building's health reaches 0, it becomes a Ruin for the rest of the game and cost the player 100 gold a turn

Building Types:
